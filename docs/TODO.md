# Pipupdate TODO list

## TODOS

### 1. **Code Development and Testing:**

- Complete the implementation of all functions and classes, ensuring they meet their design specifications.
- Write unit tests for each module (`main.py`, `pip_batch_update.py`, `get_pip_cmds.py`, `log_utils.py`, etc.) to ensure functionality works as expected.
- Perform integration testing to ensure all parts of the system work together seamlessly.
- Add exception handling across the application to manage errors gracefully.

### 2. **Functionality Enhancements:**

- Implement additional features in `pip_batch_update.py` such as handling specific package updates or exclusions.
- Improve the logging mechanism in `log_utils.py` to support different logging levels and formats.
- Optimize the `batcher` function to handle large sets of packages more efficiently.

### 3. **Documentation:**

- Complete the docstrings for all functions and classes, ensuring they are detailed and follow a standard format.
- Create a comprehensive `README.md` file that includes an introduction, installation instructions, usage examples, and a troubleshooting section.
- Write detailed documentation in `docs/`, including `pip_config.md` and `powershell_profile.md`, and ensure they provide valuable information for setup and configuration.

### 4. **Environment and Dependencies:**

- Finalize the `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` files to ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and managed.
- Set up a virtual environment for development and testing to ensure dependencies are isolated from the system Python environment.

### 5. **Deployment and Distribution:**

- Ensure scripts like `build_and_push.sh` are correctly configured for building and deploying the package to PyPI.
- Test the installation process from PyPI in different environments to ensure it works correctly.

### 6. **Version Control and Branch Management:**

- Use git for version control, ensuring all changes are committed with meaningful commit messages.
- Implement a branching strategy for features, bug fixes, and releases.

### 7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Configure pipelines to run tests on multiple operating systems and Python versions.

### 8. **User Feedback and Iteration:**

- Collect user feedback on the tool's functionality and usability.
- Plan for iterative releases to incorporate feedback and new features over time.

### 9. **Security and Compliance:**

- Conduct a security audit to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
- Ensure the software complies with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
