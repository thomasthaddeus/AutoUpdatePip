"""pip_batch_update.py

A script to batch update outdated pip packages.

This script identifies outdated pip packages, updates them in batches of 10,
logs errors, and displays the difference between initially outdated and
post-updated packages.

Returns:
    None: The results are printed to the console and errors are logged.

Yields:
    None: This script does not contain a generator for external consumption.
